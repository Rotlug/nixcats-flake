# Neovim config for lazy people

The goal of this config is to allow me to not really change my workflow between this editor and vscode and the likes.

Thus, i have set the following keybinds:

## Custom Keybinds:
* `Alt+/` - Comment selection
* `Alt+Up/Down` - Move current selection up or down
* `Ctrl+Up/Down` - Scroll half page up/down
* `Ctrl+S` - Save file
* `Alt+F` - Find and replace in file
